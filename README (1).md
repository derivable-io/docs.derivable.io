# Trading Manual

Holding position in Power Perpetual is holding derivative tokens. E.g. $${ETH}^4$$, $${BNB}^2$$, $${BTC}^{-8}$$

Trading or changing Power Perpetual positions is swapping/converting some derivative tokens to another. E.g. swapping from $${ETH}^4$$ to $${ETH}^8$$ is increasing exposure/leverage of the same position.

Opening a position (or increasing a position value) is swapping from non-derivative tokens (BNB, WBNB, BUSD, CAKE\_WBNB\_BUSD) to derivative tokens ($${BNB}^2$$, $${BNB}^{-4}$$).

Closing a position (or decreasing a position value) is swapping from derivative tokens to non-derivative tokens.
